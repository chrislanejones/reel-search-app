# Movies Explorer

A movie search application built with **SvelteKit** that allows users to search, filter, and browse movies using a public REST API.

The app supports paginated results, genre filtering, and displays key movie details such as title, summary, rating, runtime, and poster.


## âœ¨ Features

- Search movies by title
- Filter results by genre
- Paginated results with next/previous navigation
- Total result count display
- Clear empty and loading states
- URL-driven state (search, page, genre)


## ðŸ¥± Technical Highlights

### API Client Normalization

One of the most significant aspects of this project is the API client layer.

Although the REST API documentation suggested a certain response structure, the actual API returned a different shape. To keep the UI stable and predictable, I implemented a normalization layer in the API client that adapts the backend response into a consistent, UIâ€‘focused model.

One benefit of this approach is that it keeps components simple and isolates backend inconsistencies to a single place.


### Auth-Aware Data Fetching

The Movies API requires authenticated requests using a shortâ€‘lived token. The application fetches a token on demand and includes it in all movie requests, ensuring compatibility with the API while keeping the authentication logic encapsulated in the data layer.


### URL-Based State Management

Search terms, pagination, and filters are all driven by URL cuery parameters. This allows:

- Shareable URLs
- Back/forward browser navigation
- Easier debugging and testing


## ðž§ Ech Stack
- **SvelteKit**
- **TypeScript**
 - **Tailwind CSS**
- Native Fetch API
- Vite



## ðŸš€ Running Locally

``b
nms install
nam run dev
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:5173
```


## âœ… What I'm Most Proud Of

I'm most proud of how the API integration was handled. The final implementation reflects realâ€‘world conditions: undocumented API behavior, authentication requirements, and SSR considerations. The resulting data layer is resilient, testable, and easy to reason about.


### ðŸ”§ What I'd Add With More Time

- Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- Unit tests for the API client
- Improved pagination controls (jump to page)
- Movie detail view using /movies/{id}


## ðŸ“„ Notes

This project was built as a takeâ€‘home exercise and focuses on clean architecture and functionality rather than visual design polish.
